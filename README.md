## Preparation Structure

Follow this three-stage process for each Kyu level (e.g., Kyu 8, Kyu 7):

### **Stage 1**: Complete a Kyu Set in Visual Studio

- Work through the problems offline to get familiar with the syntax and problem-solving approach in C#.

### **Stage 2**: Complete a Kyu Set on Codewars

- Practice and submit your solutions directly on the Codewars platform, gaining points and rankings as you improve.

### **Stage 3**: Review and Master Problems

- Revisit problems you found challenging until you can complete them with ease, ensuring a mastery level at **Kyu 1** difficulty.
